-so basically this thing creates "mods" folder in C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Roaming\Minecraft Bedrock\ and each dll put in there will be injected instantly when mc starts

-can be used with other mods from my github (mc license bypass, ore ui disable, fps, etc.) and any other dlls at all

note: for it to work u must

1. Download the DLL from the Releases page.

2. Rename the file to vcruntime140_1.dll.

3. Place it in your Minecraft installation folder (the same directory as Minecraft.Windows.exe).

Thatâ€™s it! No extra setup required.
